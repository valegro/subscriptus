* Move the mailers to app/models/mailers
* Specs for CM Calls for User and Subscription (expectations)
* Appropriate content for all emails
* Use Delayed Job for callbacks to email and CM
* Move all callbacks to observers
* Stop CM Loading the API EVERY SINGLE REQUEST!
* Need many more tests for subscriptions - test the entire workflow!
* When activating a subscription should we increase the expires_at value? Ie; not do this at the controller level? This will make it easier to log stuff too
* Log that a payment was made in activity log
* Format all times in Melbourne TZ (or a config option)
* Check CM Callbacks in User model
* When creating a payment should we be adding it to the subscription or to the user? - Which model needs recurrent_id - should we call this gateway_token?
* For the moment, I suggest using the user_id for the payment reference number but perhaps we should salt this later?? (we only have 20 chars which is the max 64 bit number as a str)

Signup
* What do we do if the email address already exists?
 - could be an existing active user or not
* Maybe we need allocated for gifts as well as on_hand??
* Set titles
* Set gender from title
* Fix reform fields
* Do we auto generate login for active users as well?
* Cukes
* Set offer and source properly
* Email lookup for active users
* Set amount and offer term on subscription
* Set order ID properly
* Link for Terms and Conditions
* Spec for payment
* Set subscription to active for paid subs
* Set expires_at - this may not be set with webhooks either

DONE
* Check integration tests for webhooks
* Validate Card
* Split the subscription observers up into tasks - eg; logging, campaign master, mail etc
